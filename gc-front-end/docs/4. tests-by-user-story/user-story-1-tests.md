# User story 1 tests

- As a user
- I want to be able to register for an account
- So that I can access features restricted to registered users

## Modal (MDL)

The registration and sign-in forms are both displayed in a model element.

- [x] US1-MDL-1: It should render children passed as props
- [ ] US1-MDL-2: It should call onClose when this is passed as an argument
